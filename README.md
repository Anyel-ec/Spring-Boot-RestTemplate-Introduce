### README: Product Management and REST Consumer Microservices

This project implements two microservices within a single Spring Boot project: one for CRUD operations on products and another for consuming this service using RestTemplate.

#### Project Structure

The project is structured into the following main packages:

- `top.anyel.rest.model`: Contains the `Product` class, which represents the data model of a product.
- `top.anyel.rest.repository`: Here lies `ProductRepository`, which manages the storage and retrieval of products in memory, and `RestTemplateRepository`, which performs operations to consume the first microservice.
- `top.anyel.rest.service`: Contains `ProductService`, encapsulating business logic for CRUD operations on products, and `RestTemplateService`, which provides methods to consume the product service using RestTemplate.
- `top.anyel.rest.controller`: Defines REST controllers for both microservices: `ProductController` for CRUD operations on products and `RestTemplateController` for consuming the product service via RestTemplate.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Product Management Microservice (`top.anyel.rest`)**:
    - **Model**: `Product` defines product attributes and methods to calculate total price.
    - **Repository**: `ProductRepository` manages a list of products in memory with basic CRUD operations.
    - **Service**: `ProductService` provides methods to interact with `ProductRepository` and execute CRUD operations.
    - **Controller**: `ProductController` exposes REST endpoints to list all products, get a product by ID, create, update, and delete products.

2. **REST Consumer Microservice (`top.anyel.rest.repository` and `top.anyel.rest.service`)**:
    - **RestTemplate Repository**: `RestTemplateRepository` uses RestTemplate to consume the product management service (`http://localhost:8080/products`).
    - **RestTemplate Service**: `RestTemplateService` encapsulates calls to `RestTemplateRepository` to fetch products in different formats and perform creation and update operations.
    - **RestTemplate Controller**: `RestTemplateController` defines REST endpoints to consume the product service via RestTemplate, allowing fetching products in JSON, objects, and performing creation and update operations.

#### Endpoint Usage

- **Product Management Microservice Endpoints (`/products`)**:
    - `GET /products`: Get all products.
    - `GET /products/{id}`: Get a product by ID.
    - `POST /products`: Create a new product.
    - `PUT /products`: Update an existing product.
    - `DELETE /products/{id}`: Delete a product by ID.

- **REST Consumer Microservice Endpoints (`/api/products`)**:
    - `GET /api/products/json`: Get all products in JSON format.
    - `GET /api/products`: Get all products.
    - `GET /api/products/objects`: Get all products as objects.
    - `POST /api/products`: Create a new product using RestTemplate.
    - `POST /api/products/exchange`: Create a new product using RestTemplate with exchange.
    - `PUT /api/products`: Update a product using RestTemplate with exchange.
    - `GET /api/products/stream`: Get products using RestTemplate in streaming format.

#### Configuration and Execution

1. **Project Setup**:
    - Ensure Java and Maven are properly configured in your development environment.

2. **Execution**:
    - Clone the repository and open the project in your preferred IDE.
    - Run the application as a Spring Boot application.
    - The microservices will be available on configured ports (typically `8080` for both product service and consumer service, adjustable in `application.properties`).

#### Dependencies

The project utilizes the following core dependencies:
- Spring Boot Web for creating REST APIs.
- Lombok to reduce boilerplate code in model classes.
- Jackson for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- RestTemplate for making RESTful calls over HTTP.
